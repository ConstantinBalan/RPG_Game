Summary: The Lizardmen have always swam in the waters of Taralask Grove, but not always as men. According to records of the High Elves, the grove was only home to small lizards and bugs in the early portion of The Age of the Unsettled Dawn. A species of lizards rapidly evolved to represent their surrounding superiors. The lizard creatures appeared to morph to resemble humans at almost twice their height and more than three times their intelligence. Restricted only by their own volition, they continue to adapt and learn from their environment, to one day become a significant force in Peybos.
