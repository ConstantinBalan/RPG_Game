Summary: Nestled in the heart of the Whispering Forest, the Wood Elves are considered to be one with the planet. Tending to the woods they reside in and coexisting with the flora and fauna of Peybos, they use their innate skills to take advantage of their natural surroundings. The elders say that the first Wood Elves were birthed from the Dordove trees deep in the forest before any of the other races appeared on the planet. Before the Tumari Wastes cut the vast expanse of their woodland, they were the largest kingdom ever recorded.
